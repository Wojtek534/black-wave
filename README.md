# [IN PROGRESS] Black Wave

## React base collection of components with storybook example

## Requirements:

- Tailwind
- React

### Main Goals

1. Components styling can be easily modified without changing it's implementation. That's why components style can't rely directly on classes
2. Styling components need to be consistent in styling and rely on each other like hierarchical tree (with no seperate styling applying same classes)
3. Adjusting or expanding styling options can't break refrences
